# MEMS-SIM
This repository is under construction and in development.

In the folders are details about the material list and costs to build a MEMS-SIM microscope as described in the BioRxiv preprint. Additionally there are 3D-designs, a basic control code specifically tailored to the MEMS used for the microscope and electronics diagram for the control.
